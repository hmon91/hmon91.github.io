## 1. Safety Verification of Neural Feedback Loops
My primary research focus is ensuring that learning-enabled systems (like robots using Neural Networks) do not crash. 

**Key Papers:**
* [Ensuring Both Positivity and Stability...](/publication/2024-01-01-lcss-positivity)
* [Robust Stability Analysis...](/publication/2025-09-01-ccta-robust)

**Explanation:**
For these projects, I use **Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs)** to model the neural network error...

## 2. Crowd Dynamics & Control
In this track of research, I model how crowds move in emergency scenarios...
