[cite_start]I am a **Ph.D. researcher** at Northeastern University developing foundational methods for trustworthy and scalable artificial intelligence in dynamical systems. [cite_start]My work lies at the intersection of **data-driven learning, optimization, and control theory**, with a focus on formal verification, robustness, and safety guarantees for neural-network-based decision-making systems[cite: 7].

[cite_start]I develop theory, algorithms, and software for certifying learning-enabled systems operating in complex, safety-critical environments, with applications spanning autonomous systems and robotics[cite: 8].

### Research Highlights
* [cite_start]**Scalable Verification:** Developed a scalable stability and robustness verification pipeline for learning-enabled autonomous systems, achieving up to ~$10^4 \times$ speedup over state-of-the-art methods[cite: 38].
* [cite_start]**Neural Network Bounding:** Introduced novel global and local sector-bounds for Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs), enabling depth-agnostic and input-aware bounds with tighter certification than methods like CROWN[cite: 37].
* [cite_start]**Tool Integration:** Integrated verification tools (AutoLIRPA, JAX-Verify) with classical control analysis (Lyapunov methods, MPC) to build reproducible verification workflows[cite: 39].

[cite_start]I am currently working on my thesis: *"Scalable Method for Stability and Robustness Verification of Systems with NN Feedback using Positivity Constraints"*[cite: 18].
