I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at **Northeastern University**, advised by Prof. [Advisor Name].

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Control Theory** and **Machine Learning**. Specifically, I focus on:
* **Robust Control:** Analyzing stability in uncertain dynamical systems.
* **Neural Network Feedback:** Ensuring positivity and stability using sector-bounded nonlinearities.
* **Linear Systems:** Working with Feedforward neural networks (FFNNs) and Lur'e systems.

I am currently working on [brief mention of your current project or paper].
